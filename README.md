# Introduction
This is a boilerplate code/config to get started with testing in mocha framework. Adding Chai is easy - just add it to karma.conf.js file.

# Running the test cases

    grunt

# Concept

Always have UI and logic separated. This will help in unit testing a lot and also in isolating the UI test cases. The boiler plate shows how to separate
them and use them together. Run `grunt http-server` to run the server and see how everything comes together in html.
